# PressText, by Thomas Hughes
### CS Thesis, Princeton '24

To engage with PressText, users first text “News” to a dedicated phone number. They then receive an explanation of what PressText is and how it works, via text message, and respond by texting the news topics with which they wish to engage and learn more about. PressText sends them one-sentence summaries of 5 articles from The Associated Press about these topics everyday from then on. If they have a question about any of the articles, they can text it, and receive an instant response, sourced directly from the contents of the pieces. This is the news, made interactive, conversational, and universally accessible.
